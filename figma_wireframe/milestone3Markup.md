1. Project Idea and Goals:

Campus Connect is a web application designed to help students discover campus events and connect with other students who have similar interests.

Primary Goals: Provide a centralized, easy-to-browse platform for all UIC students.Help students "find their crew" by making it easy to see who is interested in an event and facilitating social connections.Increase student engagement in campus life by lowering the barrier to finding activities and friends.

3. Design:

We chose specific UI patterns to create an intuitive and efficient user experience. The initial flow, from the Landing Page to the Login or Create Account options and then to the Home screen, follows a universally understood pattern, allowing both new and returning users to navigate without confusion while immediately highlighting the app’s value through “Discover Events.” On the Home Screen, we implemented a card-based layout for the “Upcoming Events” section because cards are visually appealing, highly scannable, and mobile-friendly, enabling users to quickly browse multiple events and see key information at a glance. For event discovery, we adopted a standard List-to-Detail navigation pattern, letting users select an event from the Home Screen card view to drill down into the Event Details screen, keeping the Home Screen uncluttered and revealing detailed information only when requested. Finally, the app’s core social feature, the “Find Friends for this Event” button, is prominently placed on the Event Details page, following the logical flow that once a user is interested in an event, the next step is naturally to see who else is going or find companions to attend with.

4. Assumptions, Limitations, Questions:

Assumptions: We assume users want a social feature ("Find Friends") and aren't just using the app for event discovery.We assume "Major" (collected during sign-up) is a useful data point for filtering events or connecting users.

Limitations: The current flow does not show how a user can create an event (e.g., for a student organization).The wireframes do not yet include User Profile pages or a "Friends List" management system.The "What's Happening" feed from Screen 1 is not yet designed.

Questions: What does the main "Events" page (from the top navigation bar) look like? How does it differ from the "Upcoming Events" on the home page? (We assume it will have robust search and filtering). How are user profiles managed and displayed?

5. Future Impovements we will make:

Design the complete user flow for the "Find Friends" feature, as this is our core value proposition.Design the full "Events" page, including filters for date, event type, and user's major.Design the User Profile pages (both viewing your own and others').
