Weekly Meeting Notes: 11/11/2025

This week, the team made strong progress toward completing our Milestone 4 requirements. Om officially finished all of the Figma wireframes so he will start working with Malak on finishing the frontend screens, giving the team a finalized design to follow. With the wireframes now complete, Malak is continuing to work on finishing the remaining frontend screens and ensuring that the UI matches the finalized layout and flow. On the backend side, Mandar and Jovan are very close to completing their remaining functionality. Most of the core backend logic is now implemented, and they are wrapping up the last endpoints and integrations needed before we begin testing. As a team, we reviewed the current build and confirmed that we are approaching the stage where we can test the entire project end-to-end. Our main goal for the upcoming week is to finish the remaining frontend and backend components so that we can run the full application on one machine and begin debugging before our Milestone 4 meeting.
