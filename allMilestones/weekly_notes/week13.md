Weekly Meeting Notes: 11/18/2025

This week, the team made final progress as we near the completion of Milestone 4. Most frontend and backend components are now fully implemented, and we are primarily focused on last-minute fixes, polish, and making sure everything works smoothly together. Om and Malak have finalized the frontend screens and are now refining small UI adjustments while integrating the remaining interactions. On the backend, Mandar and Jovan have completed all required functionality and are now performing integration checks to ensure that the API and frontend communicate correctly. As a team, we are actively testing the application end-to-end on a single machine to verify that all features behave as expected. We are also preparing the slide deck and organizing our talking points for the upcoming Milestone 4 meeting. The main focus moving forward is tightening up any outstanding issues, ensuring consistent behavior across the app, and finalizing our demo materials for tomorrows meeting.
