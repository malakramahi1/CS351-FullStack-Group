Weekly Meeting Notes: 11/06/2025

This week, our team focused heavily on preparing for Milestone 4, where the full prototype must be 100% functional and fully runnable on our local machines. Om continued improving the Figma wireframes, making sure each screen clearly reflects the final version expected for the instructor review. Based on these updated designs, Malak is now finishing the next set of frontend pages and working on polishing alignment, responsiveness, and consistency across the UI to avoid any of the frontend penalties listed in the Milestone 4 rubric.
On the backend side, Mandar and Jovan are integrating the advanced data structures into the system and finalizing the remaining endpoints so every required feature communicates properly with the frontend. This includes ensuring login, registration, and all data-dependent functionality work without bugs and can be demonstrated during the TA review.
As a team, we discussed the expectations for the Milestone 4 meeting, confirmed our availability for scheduling the 30-minute test session, and planned our tasks for the upcoming week. For next week, we aim to: Finalize full frontend–backend integration, Test the entire app so it runs cleanly on one machine,Fix UI polish issues and backend bugs.
