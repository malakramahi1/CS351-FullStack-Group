## Q3c           
Our excpected response time is 12 Hours 
                                
## Q4a
If there is a disagreement, we will talk it out in a short group call or chat.
Everyone can share their view, and then we will take a quick vote.
The majority decision wins. If it’s tied, the project lead makes the final
call.

## Q4b
First, we will send a friendly reminder and ask if they need help. If it 
continues, we will set smaller, clear tasks with deadlines. If they still 
don’t contribute, we will let the TA know so the workload can be fairly balanced
.

## Track 1: Tackling Generative AI Consequences

  Problem 1
Writers and artists are worried that their work is being scraped from the internet and used to train generative AI models without permission. This happens silently because datasets are built from massive online collections. Creators lose control of their intellectual property, and trust in AI systems decreases because there is no transparency.
 
Solution 1
Build a small web app that acts as a **community hub** where creators can:
- Upload their original works.  
- Post screenshots or examples of suspected unauthorized use in AI datasets.  
- Tag and comment on suspicious matches to crowdsource evidence.  
- Share legal/educational resources about copyright and licensing.  

The goal is not to build an unreliable AI detector, but instead to give creators a transparent platform to track and discuss potential misuse. This empowers artists with more control and raises awareness of ethical AI practices.


## Track 2: Technology for Public Goods

  Problem 2
UIC students struggle to quickly find study buddies, project partners, or local campus events in one place. Right now they rely on random group chats, flyers, or word of mouth, which is inefficient and not inclusive.

  Solution 2
Build a web app where students can:
- Create a simple profile  
- Post or join study groups and campus events.  
- Use filters (by course code, date, topic) to discover opportunities.  
- Send direct messages to group/event organizers.  

This solves the discovery, connection problem in a centralized, accessible way. The idea will be called College Event Friend Finder.


  Problem 3
New students often don’t know where to find reliable campus resources like tutoring, office hours, or study spaces. They waste time searching across multiple sites or miss opportunities.

  Solution 3
Add a **Resource Directory** feature:
- Curated list of academic resources, labs, and office hours.  
- Tags for type .  
- Short text notes from students  
- Map/location info if relevant.  

This improves accessibility and ensures everyone can quickly find support tools.


## Track 3: Creative Coding and Cultural Expression
Problem 3
Many people that visit Chicago, or even some locals might be unaware of all the history behind the city. They might only know from word of mouth, which for visitors can be a problem.

Solution 3
Make an interactive app that allows people to:
- Learn the history of Chicago
- Explore specific themes of Chicago, like  architecture and music
- Scroll through a timeline of events that took place
- Add some quizzes to help determine knowledge

The goal of this app is to allow people to interact with the history of Chicago in a easy manner, for people to understand the history.

## Idea Finalization
For the semester, we are using the College Event Friend Finder project(That we talked about in Track 2). By connecting users with friends, this program enhances social interaction and connection at local or university events. We selected it because our app can encourage more active participation from students who often miss out on activities because they lack companions. To make sure it fits community expectations, the app will concentrate on UIC students. Features will be created to facilitate engagement, connection, and teamwork, making it simpler and more easier to participate in events.
